- Requirements

   - Net-SNMP libraries and headers.
   - Qt4 libraries and headers.
   - Makefile generation tool QMake.

   You can obtain Net-SNMP and Qt from its websites or through your package manager on unix systems.

- Installation

   - Generate a platform-specific makefile:

      qmake

   - Build library

      make

   - Install library and headers

      make install 
      
   Now you can begin to use qt-net-snmp in your C++/Qt projects.
